* Japanese Name Hacks

If there is "JapaneseAutorMap:.*" string in a note of the entry in the
Papers applications' paper entries, strings following it is treated as
mapping between English name into Japanese name. For example,

JapanesAuthorMap: Yamada Taro: _YAMADA_ _TARO_, Yamada Jiro: _YAMADA_ _JIRO_

# _NAME_ denotes kanji characters

Maps english napes into Japanese name, respectively.
